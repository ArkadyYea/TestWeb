    //-Why can we access foo before we have declared it? 
    //  • If we follow the creation stage, we know the variables have already been created before the activation / code execution stage.
    //    So as the function flow started executing, foo had already been defined in the activation object. 
    //-Foo is declared twice, why is foo shown to be function and not undefined or string? 
    //  • Even though foo is declared twice, we know from the creation stage that functions are created on the activation object before variables,
    //    and if the property name already exists on the activation object, we simply bypass the decleration. 
    //  • Therefore, a reference to function foo() is first created on the activation object, and when we get interpreter gets to var foo,
    //    we already see the property name foo exists so the code does nothing and proceeds. 
    //-Why is bar undefined? 
    //  • bar is actually a variable that has a function assignment, and we know the variables are created in the creation stage
    //    but they are initialized with the value of undefined. 
    (function() {

    	document.write('<br/>'+typeof foo); // function pointer
    	document.write('<br/>'+typeof bar); // undefined

        var foo = 'hello',
        bar = function() {
            return 'world';
        };

        function foo() {
            return 'hello';
        }

    }());
        
    
    document.write('<br/><br/>After<br/>');
