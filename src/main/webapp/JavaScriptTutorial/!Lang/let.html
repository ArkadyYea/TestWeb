    //let allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. This is unlike
    //the var keyword, which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.
    //Variables declared by let have as their scope the block in which they are defined, as well as in any contained sub-blocks. In this way, let works
    //very much like var. The main difference is that the scope of a var variable is the entire enclosing function.
    //At the top level of programs and functions, let, unlike var, does not create a property on the global object.
    //Redeclaring the same variable within the same function or block scope raises a SyntaxError.
    //When used inside a block, let limits the variable's scope to that block. Note the difference between var whose scope is inside the function where it is declared.
